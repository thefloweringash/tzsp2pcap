# tzsp2pcap

## Introduction
It is a simple utility to listen for [TaZmen Sniffer Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TZSP) (TZSP)
packets and output the contents on stdout in pcap format. It has only
been lightly tested with Mikrotik RouterOS products, and may need
alterations to work with other devices.

## Installation
```
make && sudo make install
```

## Usage
Usage is simple:
```
tzsp2pcap [-h] [-v] [-f] [-p PORT] [-o FILENAME] [-s SIZE]
```

The -h flag shows the help for the utility.

The -v flag controls verbosity (repeat to increase up to -vv).

The -f flag forces output flush after every packet.

The -p flag lets you specify port to listen on (default is 37008).

The -o flag specifies path of output file (default is stdout)

The -s flag sets size of received buffer (default is 65535).

Example usage:
```
tzsp2pcap -f | wireshark -k -i -
```
