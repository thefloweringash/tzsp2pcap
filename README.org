#+TITLE: tzsp2pcap

* Introduction
This is a simple utility to listen for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TZSP][TaZmen Sniffer Protocol]] (TZSP)
packets and output the contents on stdout in pcap format. It has only
been lightly tested with Mikrotik RouterOS products, and may need
alterations to work with other devices.

* Example usage
: tzsp2pcap -f | wireshark -k -i -
: tzsp2pcap -o "file.pcap" -C 1000000 # rotate file every 1MB (file.pcap.1, file.pcap.2, etc)
: tzsp2pcap -o "file_%s.pcap" -G 10 # create new file every 10 seconds (file_UNIXTIMESTAMP.pcap)
